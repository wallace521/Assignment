			<h2>What is Lyrica?</h2>
				<p>Lyrica (pregabalin) is an anti-epileptic drug, also called an anticonvulsant. It works by slowing down impulses in the brain that cause seizures. Lyrica also affects chemicals in the brain that send pain signals across the nervous system.

Lyrica is used to control seizures and to treat fibromyalgia. It is also used to treat pain caused by nerve damage in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), herpes zoster (post-herpetic neuralgia, or neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury.

Lyrica may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p>

		<p>You may have thoughts about suicide while taking Lyrica. Your doctor will need to check you at regular visits. Do not miss any scheduled appointments.

Call your doctor at once if you have any new or worsening symptoms such as: mood or behavior changes, depression, anxiety, insomnia, or if you feel agitated, hostile, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself.

If you are taking Lyrica to prevent seizures, keep taking the medication even if you feel fine.

Do not stop using Lyrica without first talking to your doctor, even if you feel fine. You may have increased seizures or withdrawal symptoms such as headache, sleep problems, nausea, and diarrhea. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using Lyrica.

Do not change your dose of Lyrica without your doctor's advice. Tell your doctor if the medication does not seem to work as well in treating your condition.

Wear a medical alert tag or carry an ID card stating that you take Lyrica. Any medical care provider who treats you should know that you take seizure medication.</p>
